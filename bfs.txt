Here's how the BFS algorithm works:

Create a queue and mark all vertices as not visited.
Enqueue the source vertex into the queue and mark it as visited.
While the queue is not empty, do the following:
Dequeue a vertex from the queue.
Process the dequeued vertex (e.g., print it or perform any desired operation).
Enqueue all its adjacent vertices that have not been visited and mark them as visited.
Repeat step 3 until the queue is empty.
The BFS algorithm guarantees that it will visit all the vertices reachable from the source vertex and that it will visit them in the shortest path order.
